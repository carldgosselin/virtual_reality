## Emotional Themes: Joy, Fear and Trust in Yourself
The aim in this capstone project is to create a confidence-boosting application.  
This app aims to get the viewer motivated and pumped up for their next big challenge.
Three emotions come to mind when facing the next big challenge: joy, fear and trust in yourself.  
In this virtual environment, the viewer can feel comfortable in reflecting on these emotions prior to their next challenge.

### User testing outcomes and iterations

Two major changes:  Viewing height and sound consistency.  Testing the application early and frequently kept the bugs and changes small and incremental.  
It helped mitigate large mistakes that would have taken a lot of time to resolve if discovered further down the road.
With early user testing, I was able to adjust the height of the game and the speed of movement early in the process.
