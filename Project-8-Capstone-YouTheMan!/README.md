## Project Overview

You will be doing research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. 
After conducting your research, you will be creating a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. 
These booths should showcase your findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. 
Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. 
This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the information about your research. 
Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

Look around and research topic for the project. This can be: <br>
- A VR company
- A VR technology
- An industry that has the potential to be impacted by VR

### Create a scene to showcase the findings from your research
### Create a VR scene with navigation and instructions, which showcases the findings from your research. 
This could take the form of a gallery, a museum, or a more creative showcasing of the topics at hand. 
This scene should include at least 5 'display points' which educate viewers on the topic at hand. 
These display points can use VR objects, text, images, or video to convey the information at hand and must also emit relevant audio (either educational or complementary to the theme). 
Users should be able to freely navigate around the space to learn about the topic you have researched.

- Deploy, Test and Optimize
- Be sure that the scene runs on your device and meets the project requirements.
- Make sure performance is acceptable.
- Apply what you've learned in prior courses to optimize the scene.

## The final VR application

The final VR file is located in the "build" folder and has an extension of "apk" for Android deployment.
