# VR Gallery - SUMMARY AND PROCESS OF WORK

## Introduction

I built a confidence-boosting application as part of Udacity's Virtual Reality Development Nanodegree.  This application took me about X weeks to complete (design, test, build and repeat).
I took a considerable amount of time designing and testing the application early in the process so that I could "fail fast" and make incremental changes throughout the process.
I took the time to conduct multiple rounds of user testing to get early feedback on the virtual environment, the instructional panels, movement from one video to another, and testing the final product.
The multiple rounds of user testing helped in keeping the bugs and scale of changes to a minimum.  The final product is a virtual space with X video booths surrounding the viewer and boosting his/her confidence.

## Statement of purpose
This application is a mobile VR application for people that want to engage in a confidence boosting activity before entering a meeting or attending an social event.

## The Process

### Choosing the ideal persona

For the design of this game, I chose my wife, Andrea, as the ideal persona.

### Choosing the achievements (application features) from Udacity documentation

This capstone project requires the selection of many "achievements" (application features) to be included in the final application to be considered complete. <br>
You can find the complete list of Udacity "achievements" in this <a href="documentation/030 - Achievements - Udacity Capstone Requirements.docx">document</a>. <br>
You can review the "achievements" that I've selected for this project <a href="documentation/031 - Identify Achievements for Capstone Project.md">here</a>.<br>

## Additional User testing

I conducted user testing early and frequently to minimize the scale of changes to the application. 
I made an attempt to "fail fast" so that the required changes stayed small.  I conducted four rounds of user testing for this application.


### User testing - Navigation - starting location, booth locations and viewing angles

**User 1**<br>
**Question: How do you feel about the starting location of this app?**<br>
**Response:** ....<br>
**Outcome:** ....<br>

**Question: Now try to navigate to the first booth on the left.  How did you do?**<br>
**Response:** ...
**Outcome:** ...<br>

**Question: Have a look at the first booth.  How is your viewing experience?**<br>
**Response:** ... <br>
**Outcome:** ...<br>

**Question: Try to navigate away from the first booth.  Can you describe this experience?**<br>
**Response:** ...<br>
**Outcome:** ... <br>

**Question: Please go ahead and navigate to the others booths.  Please describe your experience in doing so.**<br>
**Response:** ...<br>
**Outcome:** ...<br>

### User testing outcomes and iterations

Testing the application early and frequently kept the bugs and changes small and incremental.  
It helped mitigate large mistakes that would have taken a lot of time to resolve if discovered further down the road.
With early user testing, I was able to adjust the height of the game and the speed of movement early in the process.


## Conclusion

This assignment made me realize the importance of establishing a repeatable process for creating a virtual environment.  
It made evident the importance of user testing components of the game early to "fail fast".  
Getting the scale of the game right is important in the early stages of development as re-scaling at the end of the development process can take a lot more time and resources to fix.  
In virtual reality, the scale and speed of movement are core attributes to a good experience.
