## User testing

# 1.  User testing - environment

**User 1**
**1. Tell me how tall you feel in this game?**
It feels like I'm looking up at the 5 balls in front of me.  So I feel a little short in this game

**2. Tell me about your experience inside this application?**
This is a really cool virtual space.  I like it.

**3. Can you describe the mood of the environment?**
I feel like I'm in the mediavel times.  Very eery.


**User 2**
**1. Tell me how tall you feel in this game?**
I feel shorter than I usually am.  

**2. Tell me about your experience inside this application?**
This is a very cool room.  Although it feels a bit choppy and may get dizzy if I keep playing for a few more minutes.

**3.  Can you describe the mood of the environment?**
Very medieval!


# 2.  User testing - start and restart panels

**User 1**
**1. Are you seeing a panel of some sort?**
yes, I see a big black box

**2. How big does the panel feel to you?**
It feels very big.

**3. What do you think the panel is for?**
It looks like the panels is used to start a game.

**4. What do you think happens when you click on the button?**
I think the panel goes away and some sort of game starts.

**5. Go ahead and click the button.  Can you describe the second panel?**
It looks like the second panel is used to restart the game.  At this point, the user was confused as there was no game played.
I informed the user that I was only user testing the panels at this point. 


# 3.  User testing - movement
**User 1**
Action:  Please hit the start button.

**1. How did you feel about the speed of movement into the room?**
It felt a little too fast.  It was a bit disorienting.  I would like it to be a little slower.
I was surprised when I started moving.

**2. Did you feel a little sick as you were moving?**
Yes, I felt a little sick.

**3. Do you have anything else to add about the movement or anything else?**
Yes, I get stuck outside the building if I click the "restart" button from inside the room.

note:  the above is a bug where the user can click the "restart" button from inside the game room. 
Action:  the "restart" button needs to be inactive until the player is outside the building.
