## VR App Design Walkthrough

Exercise to deconstruct an existing VR application.
Application:  VR tunnel race (on Google Play)


# Likes

1.	I like that the application has the option of playing the game in both VR mode and Mono viewing modes.  
Intention:  I believe the game designer wanted to provide the user with these two options.  It is beneficial to keep the mono viewing mode available when a VR headset is not available.

2.	I like the music that accompanies the game.  The fast-paced electronic music complements the racing game.
Intention:  I believe the game designer chose fast-paced music to match the intensity and the required quick-thinking approach to avoid all obstacles in the game.

# Dislikes

1.	I had to stop playing VR mode after 3 quick games as I felt dizzy.
Intention:  I believe the game designer created a fast-paced game with a lot of moving parts and obstacles to make the game challenging and interesting.  However, There were too may abrupt visual changes on screen.  This created a bit of dizziness for me.
