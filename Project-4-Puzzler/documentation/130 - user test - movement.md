##User test for start and restart panels

##application:  Puzzler


**User 1**

Action:  Please hit the start button.

**1. How did you feel about the speed of movement into the room?**

It felt a little too fast.  It was a bit disorienting.  I would like it to be a little slower.
I was surprised when I started moving.


**2. Did you feel a little sick as you were moving?**

Yes, I felt a little sick.


**3. Do you have anything else to add about the movement or anything else?**

Yes, I get stuck outside the building if I click the "restart" button from inside the room.

note:  the above is a bug where the user can click the "restart" button from inside the game room. 
Action:  the "restart" button needs to be inactive until the player is outside the building.
