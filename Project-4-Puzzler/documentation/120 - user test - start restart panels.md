It feels very big.

It looks like the panels is used to start a game.

**4. What do you think happens when you click on the button?**

I think the panel goes away and some sort of game starts.

**5. Go ahead and click the button.  Can you describe the second panel?**

It looks like the second panel is used to restart the game.  At this point, the user was confused as there was no game played.
I informed the user that I was only user testing the panels at this point.
