# UDACITY - Virtual Reality Nanodegree

# My First VR App

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a simple mobile VR App for Google Cardboard.

What I have learned in building this project:
- How to navigate around Unity
- How to customize a preexisting experience in Unity
- How to get a project from Unity to Android


## The final VR application

The final VR file is located in the "build" folder and has an extension of "apk" for Android deployment.

## Install

Move the "MyFirstVRApp.apk" file to your favorite Android device and enjoy the experience.
