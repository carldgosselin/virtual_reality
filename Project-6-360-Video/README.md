This project took me two weeks (on and off) to complete.  The project included writing an initial script for the 360 movie, developing the storyboard, and identifying all of the elements required to shoot the film.

I enjoyed developing the script for this project.  I had to tweak the storyline as too many characters were involved in the initial script.  I also had to rewrite the story in a way that the story could be told through the eyes of the main characters at all times.  
This was a little challenging as 2D movies allows the audience to jump from one character to another at any time.  

In the end, I wanted to keep the script simple and keep the story running through the eyes of the main character at all times.
