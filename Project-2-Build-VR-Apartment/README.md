### Duration of project:  1 day
Biggest Challenge:  Creating the event trigger to spin and stop the globe.  Took me a few tries to get it right.

## Project Overview
 
Build a new apartment scene with nice lighting and custom animation. 

The goal is to design and create your own apartment based on several 3D models you'll be given. 
After you've laid out your scene then you'll deploy it to your phone. 
Next, you'll add lighting and animation.


## The final VR application

The final VR file is located in the "build" folder and has an extension of "apk" for Android deployment.

## Install

Move the "MyApartment2.apk" file to your favorite Android device and just chill for a bit.
