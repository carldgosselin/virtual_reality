# UDACITY - Virtual Reality Nanodegree

# VR Museum

## Project Overview

You will be doing research on a VR company/technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR. 
After conducting your research, you will be creating a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' which include both visual and audio feedback for users. 
These booths should showcase your findings - the goal here is to inform other people about the topic at hand in a fun and creative way through a series of (at least five) display points. 
Users should be able to travel back and forth between display areas inside the space. 
This is not a VR slideshow, it is a VR space which contains the information about your research. 
Some potential outputs of this project are creating a scene in a museum, science fair, or gallery-like space which showcases your findings.

## The final VR application

The final VR file is located in the "build" folder and has an extension of "apk" for Android deployment.

## Install

Move the "VRMuseum.apk" file to your favorite Android device and enjoy the experience.
