This project took me three weeks (on and off) to complete.  The project needed the assistance of many externel technology tools:
1. A tool to stitch 180 degree movies together.  I chose Video Stitch for this purpose.
2. A tool to combine different 360 videos together.  I chose Adobe Premiere CC for this purpose.
3. A service that could stream 360 videos through the Unity app.  I chose DropBox for this purpose.  
4. A solution that could view and manipulate a 360 within Unity.  I chose the AVPro solution for this requirement.

I found this project a good challenge with all of the many moving parts required to create the final product.  This project was not without its challenges:
A. I had to take the time to learn many new technologies and understand how everything fit together (e.g. Video Stitch to Adobe Premiere CC etc...). 
B. With Video Stitch, I had to learn to create the stitched video with a few custom settings:  stitch video as circular fishbowl, update FOB from 120 to 220, etc...
C. With Adobe Premiere, I learned that processing the videos in H.264 will save the file with a .MP4 extension
D. With DropBox, I learned that there is a daily streaming limit of 20GB.  My account got locked on the first day and I had to make a few adjustments to my project.
E. I also learned that a .MOV extension is not compatible with Android devices
F. I also had a few challenges working the AVPro solution but everything worked out it the end.

## The final VR application

The final VR file is located in the "build" folder and has an extension of "apk" for Android deployment.
